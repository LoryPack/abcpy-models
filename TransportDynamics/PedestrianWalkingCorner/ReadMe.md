# Pedestrian walking through a corner
This floor field model is for simulating pedestrians' walking throug a corner.
Three models are taken to generate the static floor field which is responsible to governing pedestrian navigation:
- a simple approach proposed by Katsuhiro Nishinari
- the block algorithm proposed by Li et al.
- the function proposed by Dias and Lovreglio
