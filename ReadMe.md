# ABCpy Models

This repository contains a number of different models implemented in ABCpy, broadly classified as following:

# Scietific area:
--------------------------------
* BiologicalScience: This folder contains the models from biological science (e.g. Platelets deposition-aggregession model))
* Climate: This folder contains the models from climate science (e.g. Lorenz 95 model of weather prediction)
* MolecularDynamics: This folder contains the models from Molecular Dynamics (e.g. TIP4P force-field of water)
* Network: This folder contains models from Network science (e.g. Various spreadiang processes on networks or mehcanistic models of network generation)
* Other: Some other models (e.g. Ecological model of Ricker)
 
These official models are a collection of example models that use ABCpy's high-level APIs. They are intended to be well-maintained, tested, and kept up to date with the latest stable ABCpy API. We especially recommend newer ABCpy users to start [here](http://abcpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README.html#getting-started).
