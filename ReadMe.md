# ABCpy Models

This repository contains a number of different models implemented in ABCpy:

The official models are a collection of example models that use ABCpy's high-level APIs. They are intended to be well-maintained, tested, and kept up to date with the latest stable ABCpy API. They should also be reasonably optimized for fast performance while still being easy to read. We especially recommend newer ABCpy users to start [here](http://abcpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README.html#getting-started).
